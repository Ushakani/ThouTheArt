Hello! In this group, Thou The Art, we like to make simple, easy, pixel arts that are free to copy, with given credit. Although, we also do complex art, big(ger) art, and much more. Come join, create, and explore! On this page, we will only be putting rules, a place to report people/images, and a way to meet with other members.
